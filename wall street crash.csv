They go into the new decade with a spring in their step, after watching world stocks add over US$25tril (RM103tril) in value in the past 10 years and a bond rally put US$13tril (RM53.66tril) worth of bond yields below zero.
They also saw Internet-based firms transform the way humans work, shop and relax. Now investors are positioning for the tech revolution's next 10 years.
Could we see a repeat of the roaring twenties, as the 1920s were known – years of prosperity, technological innovation and such social developments as women winning the right to vote?
Possibly. But there's unease, along with all the euphoria. The current economic cycle is already the longest in US history and a recession looks inevitable in the new decade – which also will mark 100 years since the Wall Street crash of 1929.
And solutions may need to be unconventional, even more so than the extraordinary policies of negative interest rates and bond-buying that eased the post-2008 global funk.
With those policies maxed out,""in the 2020s it seems inevitable that a world of helicopter money awaits,"" Deutsche Bank predicts.
That would entail central banks or governments providing citizens with large amounts of money, as though it was being dropped from helicopters, a strategy rejected even by the unorthodox policymakers of the 2010s.
Another radical option under discussion is modern monetary theory, when governments create and spend as much money as needed, so long as inflation stays low.
""Central banks have effectively invited governments to experiment with more unconventional policies,"" Deutsche said. However, those policies may pile up even more global debt, already at record highs.
So what will markets do?
A decade of rock-bottom interest rates didn't revive growth and inflation in developed nations, but they certainly inflated markets, as prices for bonds, equities and real estate show.
The inequality they spawned have also triggered a widespread backlash against globalisation. The result is a de-globalising world, or as Morgan Stanley puts it,""slow-balisation"".
The bank expects tech investments to outperform, in particular smaller Internet firms in China, as protectionism hurts larger rivals.
But it predicts less exciting returns – ""a lower and flatter frontier compared to prior decades, and especially compared to the ten years post-GFC (global financial crisis)"".
Global warming, people ageing
As market returns cool, the planet will continue to heat up. Carbon emissions, temperatures, sea levels and thus climate-induced poverty and immigration are expected to rise.
That should increasingly lead asset managers to seek alternatives to pollutants, especially coal, use of which must cease in OECD nations by 2030 for the Paris Agreement to be met.
BofA expects clean energy and electric-vehicle companies to emerge as winners, estimating the clean energy market to be already worth US$300bil (RM1.24tril).
Ageing populations are another challenge, making demographics a key investment criterion. Deutsche Bank names Ireland, Rwanda, Ghana, Botswana and Laos as among the 22 nations in line for a ""demographic dividend"", benefiting from growing working-age populations.
It also backed sectors like e-commerce as Generation Z, those who will be in their mid 20s to early 30s by 2030, exercise growing spending power.
But in some countries, affluent older spenders will still carry clout. By 2030, over 80s will represent 5.4% of the US population, up from 3.7% in 2015, driving demand for retirement homes, healthcare and long-life innovations.
""Immortality may prove the most interesting secular theme in the 2020s,"" BofA predicts.
Tech tipping points
A World Economic Forum survey in 2017 predicted a series of ""technological tipping points"" for the coming decade. They included 3D-printed cars, driverless vehicles and the first artificial-intelligence machine on a company's board.
The '20s could be an era of smart cities, where big data and robotics ensure better governance, health and connectivity, UBS forecast. It expects annual spending to turn cities smart will reach US$2tril (RM8.25tril) in 2025 and Internet-connected devices will multiply more than four-fold to 46 billion.
To take advantage of these shifts, investors will focus on areas such as autonomous vehicles – automated forklift shipments will grow to 455,000 in 2030 from 4,000 next year, ABI Research said.
Finally, advances in rocket and satellite technology are opening investment access to the final frontier. The first exchange-traded fund dedicated to the space industry opened in 2019.
UBS sees ""parallels with how the global Internet... opened up vast opportunities at the turn of the century."" It predicts the ""space economy"" will reach US$1tril (RM4.13tril) in the next couple of decades, from US$340bil (RM1.403tril) now.

wall street crash,62D7BBE2-D38F-455B-9DA6-280A045B5032,Economic crisis can trigger world war,Business/Business News,NA,https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/02/13/economic-crisis-can-trigger-world-war,"KUALA LUMPUR and BERLIN: Economic recovery efforts since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis have mainly depended on unconventional monetary policies. As fears rise of yet another international financial crisis, there are growing concerns about the increased possibility of large-scale military conflict.

More worryingly, in the current political landscape, prolonged economic crisis, combined with rising economic inequality, chauvinistic ethno-populism as well as aggressive jingoist rhetoric, including threats, could easily spin out of control and ‘morph' into military conflict, and worse, world war.

Crisis responses limited
The 2008-2009 global financial crisis almost ""bankrupted"" governments and caused systemic collapse. Policymakers managed to pull the world economy from the brink, but soon switched from counter-cyclical fiscal efforts to unconventional monetary measures, primarily ‘quantitative easing' and very low, if not negative real interest rates.

But while these monetary interventions averted realisation of the worst fears at the time by turning the US economy around, they did little to address underlying economic weaknesses, largely due to the ascendance of finance in recent decades at the expense of the real economy. Since then, despite promising to do so, policymakers have not seriously pursued, let alone achieved, such needed reforms.

Instead, ostensible structural reformers have taken advantage of the crisis to pursue largely irrelevant efforts to further ""casualise"" labour markets. This lack of structural reform has meant that the unprecedented liquidity central banks injected into economies has not been well allocated to stimulate resurgence of the real economy.

From bust to bubble

Instead, easy credit raised asset prices to levels even higher than those prevailing before 2008. US house prices are now 8% more than at the peak of the property bubble in 2006, while its price-to-earnings ratio in late 2018 was even higher than in 2008 and in 1929, when the Wall Street Crash precipitated the Great Depression.

As monetary tightening checks asset price bubbles, another economic crisis -- possibly more severe than the last, as the economy has become less responsive to such blunt monetary interventions -- is considered likely. A decade of such unconventional monetary policies, with very low interest rates, has greatly depleted their ability to revive the economy.

The implications beyond the economy of such developments and policy responses are already being seen. Prolonged economic distress has worsened public antipathy towards the culturally alien -- not only abroad, but also within. Thus, another round of economic stress is deemed likely to foment unrest, conflict, even war as it is blamed on the foreign.

International trade shrank by two-thirds within half a decade after the US passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, at the start of the Great Depression, ostensibly to protect American workers and farmers from foreign competition.
Liberalisation's discontents

Rising economic insecurity, inequalities and deprivation are expected to strengthen ethno-populist and jingoistic nationalist sentiments, and increase social tensions and turmoil, especially among the growing precariat and others who feel vulnerable or threatened.

Thus, ethno-populist inspired chauvinistic nationalism may exacerbate tensions, leading to conflicts and tensions among countries, as in the 1930s. Opportunistic leaders have been blaming such misfortunes on outsiders and may seek to reverse policies associated with the perceived causes, such as ‘globalist' economic liberalization.

Policies which successfully check such problems may reduce social tensions, as well as the likelihood of social turmoil and conflict, including among countries. However, these may also inadvertently exacerbate problems. The recent spread of anti-globalization sentiment appears correlated to slow, if not negative per capita income growth and increased economic inequality.

To be sure, globalisation and liberalisation are statistically associated with growing economic inequality and rising ethno-populism. Declining real incomes and growing economic insecurity have apparently strengthened ethno-populism and nationalistic chauvinism, threatening economic liberalization itself, both within and among countries.

Insecurity, populism, conflict
Thomas Piketty has argued that a sudden increase in income inequality is often followed by a great crisis. Although causality is difficult to prove, with wealth and income inequality now at historical highs, this should give cause for concern.

Of course, other factors also contribute to or exacerbate civil and international tensions, with some due to policies intended for other purposes. Nevertheless, even if unintended, such developments could inadvertently catalyse future crises and conflicts.

Publics often have good reason to be restless, if not angry, but the emotional appeals of ethno-populism and jingoistic nationalism are leading to chauvinistic policy measures which only make things worse.

At the international level, despite the world's unprecedented and still growing interconnectedness, multilateralism is increasingly being eschewed as the US increasingly resorts to unilateral, sovereigntist policies without bothering to even build coalitions with its usual allies.

Avoiding Thucydides' iceberg

Thus, protracted economic distress, economic conflicts or another financial crisis could lead to military confrontation by the protagonists, even if unintended. Less than a decade after the Great Depression started, the Second World War had begun as the Axis powers challenged the earlier entrenched colonial powers.

They patently ignored Thucydides' warning, in chronicling the Peloponnesian wars over two millennia before, when the rise of Athens threatened the established dominance of Sparta!

Anticipating and addressing such possibilities may well serve to help avoid otherwise imminent disasters by undertaking pre-emptive collective action, as difficult as that may be.

The international community has no excuse for being like the owners and captain of the Titanic, conceitedly convinced that no iceberg could possibly sink the great ship.
